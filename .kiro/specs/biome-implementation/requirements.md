# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves fully implementing Biome as the primary linting and formatting tool for the JavaScript application, replacing any remaining ESLint references and removing unnecessary Node.js-specific configurations. Biome is already partially configured but needs complete integration and cleanup of legacy tooling references.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Biome to be the sole linting and formatting tool, so that I have consistent code quality enforcement without conflicting tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is linted THEN Biome SHALL be the only linting tool used
2. WHEN code is formatted THEN Biome SHALL handle all formatting operations
3. WHEN ESLint references exist THEN they SHALL be completely removed from the codebase
4. IF legacy linting configurations exist THEN they SHALL be removed or replaced with Biome equivalents

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all ESLint comments and references removed from source files, so that the codebase is clean and uses only Biome directives.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ESLint disable comments are found in source files THEN they SHALL be removed or replaced with Biome equivalents
2. WHEN ESLint configuration references exist in documentation THEN they SHALL be updated to reference Biome
3. WHEN analyzer tools reference ESLint THEN those references SHALL be updated to reference Biome

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want package.json scripts optimized for Biome workflows, so that I can efficiently run linting, formatting, and checking operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN npm scripts are run THEN they SHALL use Biome commands exclusively
2. WHEN a format script is executed THEN it SHALL format all relevant files using Biome
3. WHEN a lint script is executed THEN it SHALL lint all relevant files using Biome
4. WHEN a check script is executed THEN it SHALL run both linting and formatting checks using Biome

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want unnecessary Node.js-specific configurations removed, so that the project configuration is minimal and focused.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Babel configurations exist without clear necessity THEN they SHALL be evaluated for removal
2. WHEN Jest configurations can be simplified THEN they SHALL be streamlined
3. WHEN duplicate or conflicting configurations exist THEN they SHALL be consolidated
4. IF configurations are removed THEN functionality SHALL remain intact

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Biome configuration optimized for the project's JavaScript codebase, so that linting and formatting rules are appropriate and comprehensive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Biome configuration is applied THEN it SHALL cover all JavaScript files in the project
2. WHEN linting rules are configured THEN they SHALL be appropriate for the project's coding standards
3. WHEN formatting rules are configured THEN they SHALL maintain consistency with existing code style preferences
4. WHEN Biome runs THEN it SHALL integrate properly with the existing Git workflow
